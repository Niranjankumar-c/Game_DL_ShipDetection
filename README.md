# Problem Statement
Ship or vessel detection has a wide range of applications, in the areas of maritime safety, fisheries management, marine pollution, defence and maritime security, protection from piracy, illegal migration, etc.

Keeping this in mind, a Governmental Maritime and Coastguard Agency is planning to deploy a computer vision based automated system to identify ship type only from the images taken by the survey boats. You have been hired as a consultant to build an efficient model for this project.

There are 5 classes of ships to be detected which are as follows:

* Cargo
* Military
* Carrier
* Cruise
* Tankers
